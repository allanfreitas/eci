Eventing + CodeIgniter Hybrid
-----------------------------

The purpose of this is to take a copy of CodeIgniter (version 1.7.2) and incorporate the functionality of Eventing, like multiple suffixes, the template library and some of the common functions (like replacing the CI's anchor function).
All this *without* changing any of CI's core code.
When this is complete, the CodeIgniter source code will be removed, leaving only the add-on files.
