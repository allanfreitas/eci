Eventing + CodeIgniter Hybrid
-----------------------------

The purpose of this is to take a copy of [CodeIgniter] [1] (version [1.7.2] [2]) and incorporate the functionality of [Eventing] [3], like multiple suffixes, the [template library] [4] and some of the [common functions] [5] (like replacing the CI's anchor function).
All this *without* changing any of CI's core code.
When this is complete, the CodeIgniter source code will be removed, leaving only the add-on files.
